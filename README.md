Altruist supports the following data formats:

* raw `application/json`
* URL-encoded
* form-data

## Installation

Install dependencies:

`$ npm install` or `$ yarn`

then, provide a configuration file based on the template we provide:

```sh
$ cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
```

for details about what to write in this file, See the `Actions` section below.

## Run

```sh
$ npm start [./path/to/custom-config.json]
$ # or
$ yarn start
```

The API is in v1 so every routes is prefixed with v1`. You can find your actions under :

`http://localhost:6060/api/v1/actions/{action}`
